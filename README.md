# SpaceX-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
### This is an applied data science capstone project rendered by IBM through the Coursera platform. This was a guided capstone project with the extensive assistance and guidance from expert data science course instructors. This project displays all the skills I acquired and developed throughout the entire IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Program. 
The project includes JupyterLab Python scripts of code representing the Data Collection, Data Preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Modeling and Model Evaluation stages of the data science workflow acttivities to draw insights and answer the main project goal: To predict if SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket first stage will land successfully in order to be able to determine the cost of a launch.
